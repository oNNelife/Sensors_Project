# Digital Thermometer with Dual Unit Display  

**Duration:** December 2024 – January 2025  

## Description  
Developed a digital thermometer using an AVR microcontroller (ATmega328P) and a 16x2 LCD via I2C. Implemented ADC functionality to read temperature from a 10k NTC thermistor and designed logic to dynamically display temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit based on a potentiometer. Ensured smooth and accurate temperature updates with two-decimal precision.  

## Technologies & Tools  
- **AVR Microcontroller (ATmega328P)** → main controller  
- **16x2 LCD with I2C** → display output  
- **NTC 10k Thermistor** → temperature sensor  
- **Atmel Studio + AVR libraries** → low-level programming and peripheral control  

## Features  
- Dual-unit display (Celsius and Fahrenheit)  
- Real-time temperature updates with two-decimal precision  
- ADC reading from thermistor for accurate measurements  
- Smooth and responsive display updates  
- Optimized low-level code for performance  

## Project Goals  
- Build an accurate, user-friendly digital thermometer  
- Learn microcontroller programming and ADC handling  
- Demonstrate interfacing sensors and displays with AVR hardware
